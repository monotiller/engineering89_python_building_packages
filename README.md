# Building Python Packages
## What is Python Packages? Benefits?
### Structure
1. Create an app folder
2. Inside app folder `__init__.py` that initialises the package, leave it empty though
3. Inside app folder `fizzbuzz.py`
4. `program.py` on dir level
5. `setup.py` on dir level to describe our module details such as version, author and contact details

Tree:
```
building_python_packages
+-- app
|   +-- __init__.py
|   +-- fizzbuzz.py
+-- program.py
+-- setup.py
```
